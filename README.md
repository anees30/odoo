# Odoo tutorials

This repository hosts the code for the bases and solutions of the
[official Odoo tutorials](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/howtos.html).

It has 2 branches for each Odoo version: one for the bases and one for
the solutions. For example, `16.0` and `16.0-solutions`. The first
contains the code of the modules that serve as base for the tutorials,
and the second contains the code of the same modules with the complete
solution.# odoo
